Topological Sort (Directed Acyclic Graph - DAG)
------------------------------------------------
Topological sort of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering
of vertices such that for every directed edge u â†’ v, vertex u comes
before v in the ordering.

This implementation uses Kahn's Algorithm (BFS-based).

Applications:
- Task scheduling
- Course prerequisite resolution
- Dependency resolution in build systems

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Space Complexity: O(V + E)

Note: Only works on DAGs.
