Least Common Multiple (Math)
------------------------------
The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two integers a and b is the smallest positive integer
that is divisible by both a and b.

Formula:
LCM(a, b) = abs(a * b) // GCD(a, b)

Time Complexity: O(log(min(a, b))) â€” due to GCD calculation
Space Complexity: O(1)
